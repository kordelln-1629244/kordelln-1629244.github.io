						<h2>LeBron James Career</h2>
						<p>If you really need to know anything about the greatest basketball player ever, then simply Google his name. His statistics and achievments on and off the court speak for themselve. No one has ever and I believe will ever reach the level of basketball that LeBron James has continually escalated for his 17 years as the greatest player alive. He also isnt a coke addict like MJ.</p>

									<h3>LBJ Statistics</h3>
								</header>
								<p>3x NBA Champion. 4x NBA MVP. 17x Most dominant and impactful player in the league. Not a drug addict (~MJ). </p>

									<h3>Personallity</h3>
								</header>
								<p>LeBron James has been the face and personallity of the NBA for the past 17 years. James single handedly saved the league in 2003 when he was drafted #1 overall. James is the father of 3 fantastic children and is married to his high school sweetheart. James has never been involved in any criminal activity, unless your a Gold State fan in which you would accuse him of murdering their entire franchise in one finals series.</p>

									<h3>Charity</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Lebron James started his own school in Akron Ohio where he is supporting over 2000 under privilaged kids all the way through high school. He also brought one of the worst sports franchises of all time (Clevland Caviliers) ann NBA championship. James also supported the bum Kyrie Irving into making himself seem as if he could be the #1 guy on a team (we all know how that worked out). James is also friends with KD even though he is a snake and suined the entire NBA for many years. </p>

									<h3>Statistics</h3>
								</header>
								<p>LeBron is 35, and even after 17 years in the league, he is still the best player in the league, and is still improving his skills. Stephanie Curry even cant score a point within the last 4 minutes of a finals game #trash #overrated. </p>

									<h3>MJ's addicted to drugs and gambeling</h3>

								<p>Header says it all. Dont understand how people can argue that hes the GOAT when he isnt even better than Kobe (RIP), and Kobe isnt even Top 3.</p>
